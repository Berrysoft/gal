# Introduction
`gal` project is a project for OSPP 2022.
It is a voice novel engine which aims at 3 goals: simple, free, concentrate.

## Simple
A voice novel should be easy to author.
The author need little knowledge of programming.
We provide a config file format based on YAML and TeX-like commands.
It is easy to learn and author your own voice novel.

## Free
You are free to implement anything you'd like with our script and plugin system.
The script is simple, but also strong with the plugin system.
The plugin system provides possibility to calculate and hook important parts in the runtime.

## Concentrate
The project is separated into 4 parts: runtime, plugins, config, frontend.
You can concentrate at one part without knowing about others.
If you like, you can write config file only, and author a voice novel.
You can also write your own fantastic game by customizing the frontend.
