# Internationalization
## ICU
The i18n feature are supported by ICU:

| Platform           | Library            |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Windows (10 1903+) | `icu.dll`          |
| Linux              | `libicuuc.so`      |
| macOS              | `libicucore.dylib` |

We use ICU to canonicalize locale names, and choose the best fit locale for current system.

## Simplify translation
The translation of the texts is always a difficult job. You don't need to copy all commands as is.
For example, the original text (`ja`)
``` ignore
\ch{rd}団長！車の用意できました！
\switch{おう！}{$end = false}
\switch{止まるんじゃねぇぞ！}{$end = true}
\switch{止まれ！}{}{false}
```
could be translated as (`zh_Hans`)
``` ignore
团长！车已经准备好了！
\switch{哦！}
\switch{不要停下来啊！}
\switch{停下！}
```

## Fallback
The resources, commands, and even paragraphs could be fell back, if a translated one is not apparent.
However, some other ones couldn't be fell back.

### The `\res` and `\exec` commands
The `\res` and `\exec` commands couldn't be fell back.
If there's no corresponding commands in the translated lines, they won't be referenced or executed. However, the `\ch` and `\switch` commands could be fell back.

### Fallback with empty text
However, if a certain translated line is empty, it will fall back to the base language one.
