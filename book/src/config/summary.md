# Config
Our config file is based on YAML. The structure is simple to author.

The articles below uses `gal` CLI tool to show the example,
it may behave a little different in GUI.
To run the example, you need to create a config file with full [structure](./structure.md), go to the `bins` folder and run
``` bash
$ cargo run --package gal -- path/to/config.yaml --auto
```
